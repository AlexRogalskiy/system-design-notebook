# Q&A

Q: Can I exercises and resources?<br>
A: Yes, you can! :D

Q: Why the exercises have strange names?<br>
A: Well, that isn't nice of you :'( Anyway, I was just trying to amuse myself while creating this project so I've decided to find some quotes from movies that match the exercises somehow. If you able to guess from which movies the names are taken, add them to [movies.md](movies.md) file.

Q: Can I add an exercise with normal name and not a quote from a movie?
A: Unfortunately, no. Read [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

Q: How should I learn using this repository?
A: Good question. I would start with the theory. Understand what the different terms/topics mean, which issues they were invented to solve. Once you feel you got enough theory or you can't or don't want to learn more theory, jump to the exercises and questions sections. You managed to solve the exercises and answer the questions by yourself? great, time to do some actual system design of real systems out there.

Q: Why System Design is important?
A: Try using a badly designed system

Q: Why to create another system design repository when there are so many great repositories out there on this topic?
A: I guess for the same reason there is more than one book/game/movie/... on the same topic. It's fun to try to approach something from a different angle. I guess I also have something for creating educational repositories...

Q: Should I use this repository for preparing to interviews?
A: I honestly don't know. It wasn't created for this reason but it may develop to the point where it's useful for that. It does contains information on interviews, but once someone will use it for preparing for interviews and will provide me with some feedback, then I could provide more definitive answer on this one.

Q: Anything else I should know?
A: You have the strangest questions. Just kidding, have fun learning about system design and one tip regarding the exercises - try to solve it by yourself, take the time you need to answer them, don't rush and don't peek at the solution ;)
