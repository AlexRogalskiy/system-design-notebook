## How to contribute

Contribute using pull requests.

## What to avoid

* Don't copy exercises from other source. 
* If you add new images, make sure they are free and can be used. If attribution is required, add it.

## What to do

* When adding an exercise, give it a name which is a quote from the movies (can be little bit modified)
